Wordpress Maps is the smoothest, easiest way to make maps for your site. No API keys required.

== Description ==

Mapster's on a mission! With Wordpress Maps, we're trying to make the best map editor and creator available for Wordpress. So many of the existing plugins out there are outdated, difficult to use, and, worst of all, hide most features behind a paywall.

With Wordpress Maps, we currently integrate MapLibre (the open source Mapbox) and Mapbox.

Learn more about the plugin, get started, and check out the documentation at [https://wpmaps.mapster.me/](https://wpmaps.mapster.me/).

You can use this plugin with or without access tokens and API keys, however you need.

A few features across different map types include:

*   Live map editor as you change and edit your map
*   Ability to add circles, markers, text, lines, polygons, and popups to your maps, and style them in many ways
*   Unlimited number of maps, unlimited features and markers
*   Control over map size, display, controls on the map, interactivity, and more
*   Integration of location searches, directions plugins, and more to come

We have a [feature request forum open](https://mapster.frill.co/b/kvj7njve/feature-ideas) where you can feel free to submit feature requests and we will prioritize and respond to these.

This plugin effectively replaces our previous WP Mapbox GL JS plugin, which was a bit old and difficult to develop. This new plugin is much simpler to use and allows much more efficient development and bug fixing.

We have some FAQs and instructions up at [https://wpmaps.mapster.me/](https://wpmaps.mapster.me/), with more coming in the coming months! Please hit us up with any feature requests or bugs that you run into.

Love,

Your Friends at [Mapster](https://mapster.me)
